# Optimized-5G-NR-Like-LDPC-Codes
Optimized 5G-NR-Like LDPC codes in the manuscript "Multi-Layer Progressive Edge Growth Algorithm for Lifting Design of 5G-NR-Like LDPC Codes"
1) PCM_for_z13to26.m: PCMs for $\Phi_A=\{13,26\}$ and $4\le M\le 12$, whose simulation results are shown in the manuscript.
2) PCM_for_z2to32.m: PCMs for $\Phi_A=\{2,4,8,16,32\}$ and $4\le M\le 12$.
3) SimResults_for_z2to32.m: Simulation results and comparison to original 5G-NR LDPC codes for the case $\Phi_A=\{13,26\}$ and $4\le M\le 12$.
